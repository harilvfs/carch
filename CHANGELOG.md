## [v4.1.6](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/compare/v4.1.5...v4.1.6) (2025-03-04)  

> [!NOTE]

> - Bug fixes  
> - Fixed distro detection ([#289](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/pull/289))  
> - Added Chaotic AUR install script ([#295](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/pull/295))

**A small update** :)

**Check the release section for core changes and details:** [v4.1.6](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.1.6)  


## [v4.1.5](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/compare/v4.1.4...v4.1.5) (2025-03-02)

This update is frequent due to changes in the Carch base structure within the repository.

It introduces a new feature to Carch, as I have used Rust to combine the main script and other Carch scripts into a single compiled binary, thanks to Rust.

### 🔑 Key Changes  

- **Carch is now a single compiled binary** 

- **Installation method has completely changed** ⚡  
  - For **Arch**, we now have a **bin version** with a precompiled Carch binary.  
  - For **Fedora**, I have removed the **rolling release** since it pulled the latest commit directly, which could introduce bugs. Fedora now uses a **stable version** instead.  
  - **Installation is cleaner**, with improvements to dependencies and fixes.

- **As usual, bug fixes** 🐛✅  

- **Carch is now available as a Cargo [crate](https://crates.io/crates/carch/4.1.5)** 📦  
  - You can install Carch via **Cargo** now! Installation guide is in the docs—check the **README**.  

- **Carch’s main script is now in the `src/` directory** 📁  

- **Documentation is back to VitePress** 📖  
  - Starlight is good, but **VitePress** is far more suitable for Carch (and for me too).  

That’s all—**a small but solid update!** 

For a detailed breakdown, check the release section: [🔗 v4.1.5 Release](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.1.5)  


## [v4.1.4](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/compare/v4.1.3...v4.1.4) (2025-02-27)  

This is a small update for Carch, with no new features introduced in this release.  

> [!NOTE]  
> This update only includes minor bug fixes related to **i3wmdotfiles**. See the details here: [#276](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/pull/276).  

Additionally, we’ve upgraded the **Carch Wiki** (or "docs") using **Starlight Astro**.  
The **VitePress documentation** is still available, and I will continue maintaining both:  

- **[VitePress Docs](https://carch-org.github.io/docs)** – [Repo](https://github.com/carch-org/docs)  
- **[Starlight Astro Wiki](https://carch-org.github.io/wiki)** – [Repo](https://github.com/carch-org/wiki)  

All Carch-related resources, including documentation and PKGBUILD management, are maintained under **[Carch-Org](https://github.com/carch-org)**.  

For a detailed list of changes in this update, check the **[release section](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.1.4)**.  

Thank you!  

Maybe next time, we’ll add some new features… I’m not sure what yet, but we’ll see! 👾


## [v4.1.3](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/compare/v4.1.2...v4.1.3) (2025-02-09)

It's been a month since I left Carch as a closed project from my side. However, this project is my first Linux project to reach this level, and I consider it quite an achievement given my knowledge and experience.  

But about a week ago, I couldn’t resist resuming this project. I want to maintain it again and make it as perfect as I can. To be honest, it's still not perfect.  

I only have around two months left to work on this before I have to leave my hometown due to personal reasons. Until then, I want to dedicate my time to improving Carch so that when I look back in the future, I can proudly say, *"I built this during that time."*  

Alright, enough rambling...  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Carch now supports **Fedora Linux**.  
> - I have **removed Carch TUI** (the Rust-based TUI) from the script.  
> - As the world continues rewriting everything in Rust, I just can't follow that trend.  

**The discussion regarding TUI removal can be found here: [#258](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/discussions/258)** 

Additionally, I am fed up with supporting **"based" distros** (Arch-based, Fedora-based, etc.). I will not guarantee support for them anymore. However, as usual, we might add support for some in the next release.  

I **never** recommend forks of forks—those so-called based distros that customize everything in their own way. They change things as they please, and it's impossible for me to provide universal support for all Arch- or Fedora-based community distros.  

Just use **Arch Linux** or a mainline distro like **Fedora**. Fedora is stable—it’s backed by Red Hat, and you won’t easily break things.  

### Changes in this release  

> - **Initial Fedora Linux support** [#257](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/pull/257)  
> - **Bug fixes** on the Arch Linux side  
> - **Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary files from the repo  
> - **New GitHub Actions**: Added workflow automation for more tasks in Carch  
> - **Issue template updated**: Now using YAML for better readability  

> [!NOTE]  
> This is the **initial release for Fedora Linux**, so bugs are expected. If you find any, please open an issue.  

> [!CAUTION]  
> Due to some mistakes on my part, there might be bugs on **both Arch and Fedora-based distros**.  
> In this stable release, **Carch will not work on based distros**.  
> However, it will work fine on **mainline Arch and Fedora**.

For more details on what's changed, I have set up a GitHub workflow to document everything properly. Unlike before, changes will no longer be listed only in the changelog—you can now find them in the release section of Carch: [here](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/releases/tag/v4.1.3).


## [v4.1.2](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2) (2025-01-07)

**This is the first release of year 2025.**  

> [!NOTE]
> However, please note that no further releases or updates will be pushed for `Carch` For the near future.
> 
> **Carch** is not dead, but I have personal reasons for pausing active development and new features. If things get better, I will work on updates and improvements again.
