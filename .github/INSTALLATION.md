## GTK

> [!CAUTION]
> The GTK version of Carch is currently under development. <br>

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need to install `Python` dependencies.

sudo pacman -S python
```

Using AUR (with `paru` or `yay`):

```bash
paru -S python
# or
yay -S python
```

### Install and Run Carch

Clone the Carch repository and run the GTK script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harilvfs/carch
cd carch
python3 carch-gtk.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> If any errors pop up while running the script, they are likely related to missing dependencies. Make sure to install all required Python dependencies.
