   - Add more themes and customization options.
   - Integrate user feedback for continuous improvement.

4. **Implement Additional Programming Languages 💻**
   - Add Rust implementations for performance-critical components.
   - Explore opportunities for parallel development in Rust.

5. **Add Window Manager (WM) Setup Scripts 🪟**
   - Create and improve installation/setup scripts for more window managers (e.g., i3, Sway).
   - Include configuration options tailored for each WM.

6. **Core System Setup Scripts ⚙️**
   - Develop beginner-friendly scripts for core system setup (e.g., package management, user configuration).
   - Include guides and documentation to assist new users.

7. **Enhance TUI with Rust 🦀**
   - Transition the TUI implementation to Rust for improved performance and maintainability.
   - Leverage Rust's features to create a more responsive interface.
