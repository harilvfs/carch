## ⬇️ Installation

Carch is also available as a package in various repositories:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/carch.svg?header_color=blue&background=lightblue&text=black)](https://repology.org/project/carch/versions)

<details>
  <summary>Arch Linux</summary>

Linutil can be installed on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with three different [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) packages:

- `linutil` - Stable release compiled from source
- `linutil-bin` - Stable release pre-compiled
- `linutil-git` - Compiled from the last commit (not recommended)

by running:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/<package>.git
cd <package>
makepkg -si
```

Replace `<package>` with your preferred package.

If you use [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) or any other [AUR Helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), it's even simpler:

```bash
paru -S linutil
```

Replace `paru` with your preferred helper and `linutil` with your preferred package.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Cargo</summary>

Linutil can be installed via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) with:

```bash
cargo install linutil
```

Note that crates installed using `cargo install` require manual updating with `cargo install --force` (update functionality is [included in LinUtil](https://christitustech.github.io/linutil/userguide/#applications-setup))
