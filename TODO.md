- Fix the i3wm script and make it usable for Fedora Linux.

- Delegate the installation of Carch to PKGBUILDs, offering both rolling and stable releases.

- Rework some documentation, as the installation method has changed.

- Main goal: ~~Make everything available for Fedora Linux as well.~~ This will take more time, but I will work on it.
